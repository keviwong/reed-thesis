- **Author:** John P. Klein, Melvin L. Moeschberger
- **Year:** 2003
- **Title:** Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data
- **Summary:** An encyclopedia-like text that covers a broad range of topics in time-to-event data analysis. The book's examples focus especially on applications to biology and medicine, but it is at its core a statistics textbook with plenty of mathematics. 
- **How does this relate?** This book contains a chapter that deals specifically with data that is censored and truncated, and goes into the mathematics of these sampling schemes. Another theme is the estimation of survival statistics (in the context of various censoring or truncation scenarios), such as the survival function, hazard rate, and cumulative hazard rate using nonparametric techniques, including the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators. Perhaps the most important topic of this book is regression analysis for survival data, covered in Chapters 8 through 12, including semiparametric proportional hazards regression models.
