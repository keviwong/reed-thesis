Literature Review
Lots of reading this week. The books that I've found to have the most coverage and detail include:
* Kleinbaum and Klein (2006) Survival Analysis - A self-learning text
* Klein and Moeschberger (2003) Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data 
* Moore (2016) Applied Survival Analysis Using R
Survival analysis involves lots of censored data. 
I also looked at some basic definitions, such as the survival and hazard functions, cumulative hazard function, mean residual life, and the mean and median lifetimes. In general, survival function estimation involve both parametric and non-parametric methods. Perhaps the most convenient (yet most unrealistic) parametric model for survival analysis is the exponential due to its constant hazard
*  Other parametric models include Weibull, log normal, log logistic, gamma,...
* Regression models include the accelerated failure-time model, which is just analogous to classical linear regression. Thereâ€™s also multiplicative hazard (e.g Cox) and additive hazard rate models. 
* Briefly read up on competing risks. When there are K competing risks (when a subject fails due to one of K > 1 causes), define the cause-specific hazard rate for risk i.
